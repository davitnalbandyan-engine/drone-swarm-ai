# Drone Swarm AI — v1.0.0

Simulation-only autonomous swarm coordination framework focused on
coverage and search missions.

This project implements mission-level decision logic for multi-agent
systems, including connectivity maintenance, frontier-based exploration,
and confidence-driven coverage completion.

## Scope & Safety

This is a **simulation-only** project.

- No hardware control / no real drone interface
- No physical dynamics or collision guarantees
- No real sensor modeling (perfect-state assumption)

It is intended for research, education, and algorithm development in non-physical environments.
